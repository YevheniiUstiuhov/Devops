# Task on the Github Actions Topic 

Here we have an application that is built using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## The task is:

- Choose an appropriate version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the application.
- Create a file `main.yml` that contains a **GitHub Action** workflow named `CI Node.js Project`.
- The workflow triggered by a **push** and **pull request** event.
- The workflow should install the application's dependencies, run its tests, and build the application.
