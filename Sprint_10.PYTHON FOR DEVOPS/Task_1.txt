Using the os module, write a script that recursively searches a directory for files with a specific extension and prints their paths.

#Solution
import os
def search_files(extension):
    files = []
    for root, d, file in os.walk("."):
        for f in file:
            if f.endswith(extension):
                files.append(f)
    return files
