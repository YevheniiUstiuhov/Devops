The JSON string and xml string will contain information about books, including their title, author, and publication year.
Extract the information and store it in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book.

Solution:

import json
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_books(json_string, xml_string):
    #JSON
    json_file = json.loads(json_string)
    books = []
    for jsbook in json_file: 
        book = {key: jsbook[key] for key in jsbook}
        books.append(book)
    #XML
    xml = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
    for xml_book in xml.findall('book'):
        book = {i.tag: int(i.text) if i.tag == 'year' else i.text for i in xml_book}
        books.append(book)
    return books
