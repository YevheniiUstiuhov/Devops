Count the number of lines in a text file that start with the string "log". The code should use regular expressions.

Solution:

import re

def count_log_files(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        log = 0
        for i in file:
            if re.match(r'^log', i):
                log += 1
    return log
